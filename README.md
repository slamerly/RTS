**RTS** is a personal 3rd-year project where I explored core features of a Real-Time Strategy game using my **custom 2D engine** with **SDL**. 

Key implemented features include **unit and group movement** with **A\* pathfinding** on a grid, and dynamic **camera movement** synchronized with unit actions.
